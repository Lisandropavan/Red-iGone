# Red iGone

## About Red iGone
Red iGone is a tool for removing red eyes out of photos.
The project started out as a web-app, but we then added
both an iPhone and an iPad application. All of the source
code is available here, as we've discontinued the project.

When we shut down Devify, we decided to open source
the entire thing, instead of having it collect dust in
some folder.

The entire project is released under GPLv3. 

## How to use and setup Red iGone
In order to use the code, you need to setup a web-server
with the API. The instructions on how to do that can be
found [here](https://github.com/teamdevify/Red-iGone/wiki/SettingUpRediGone).

The real magic behind the scene is performed by Gimp. 
We've written a custom python-script that bridges the API
and Gimp. 

## About the source code
Thee source code includes everything required, including
for the web-app, API, iPhone and the iPad app.

### The components
